# NER for Scientific Publications

Author: Rachit Jain & Anshul Bhardwaj

The project focuses on creating a NER model that identifies key tokens and classifies them into set of predefined entities. The data would involve scientific publications in the WIESP Dataset.

NER helps us extract key information from scientific papers which can help search engines to better select and filter articles.
